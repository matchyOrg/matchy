It was made as a proof of concept and is not intended for commercial usage.

### Client Side
The client does not store any personal data other than an authentication token
linked to the user credentials, necessary for the user to stay logged in and managed by
the Supabase frontend library.

All legal documents from [our used frontend libraries](https://github.com/matchyOrg/matchy/blob/main/frontend/package-lock.json)
including those from Supabase, mentioned above, also apply to this application.

<br>

### Server Side 
The server handling the user data is hosted by [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
Therefore all legal documents that apply to Supabase also apply to this application and can be found here:
- [Terms of Service](https://supabase.com/docs/company/terms)
- [Data Processing Addendum](https://supabase.com/legal/dpa) (Supabase is GDPR compliant)
- [Privacy Policy](https://supabase.com/docs/company/privacy)
- [Trust Reports](https://security.supabase.com/)

And so do all legal documents that apply to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/legal/terms) which hosts
the frontend code of our application on their servers:
